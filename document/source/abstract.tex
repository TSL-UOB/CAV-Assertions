Safety and mission performance validation of autonomous vehicles is a major challenge. We describe a methodology for constructing and applying assertion checks, operating in simulation or in the real world. 
%
An assertion library has been derived from the UK Highway Code (UKHC), as an example of a legal code of practice. 
%
Transformation of UKHC rules into logical assertions can be achieved either by direct translation or by physical modelling, to yield logical assertion expressions.
%
To validate the effectiveness of the assertion library we have performed assertion checking of the UKHC rules using a geospatial information system in an SQL database.\todo[inline]{``validation suite'' only occurs in abstract?}
%
This paper presents initial simulation and realtime video analysis experiments that apply assertions related to vehicle overtaking, and a brief analysis of the safety and mission performance characteristics measured.
\todo[inline]{What are the contributions? More detail on scope (focus on overtaking to illustrate the approach as we don't yet have a ``library''.}
