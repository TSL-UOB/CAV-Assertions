Safety and mission performance validation of autonomous vehicles is a major challenge. We describe a methodology for constructing and applying assertion checks, operating in simulation or in the real world, through the use of an assertion-based oracle. 
%
An assertion library has been derived from the UK Highway Code (UKHC), as an example of a legal code of practice. 
%
Transformation of UKHC rules into assertions can be achieved either by direct translation or by physical modelling, to yield formal logical expressions that can be monitored automatically.
%
The approach is illustrated on the example of assertion checking for vehicle overtaking, using a geospatial information system in an SQL database for validation and performance assessment.
%
We present initial simulation and realtime video analysis experiments that apply assertions relevant in a vehicle overtaking scenario together with a brief analysis of the safety and mission performance characteristics measured.
